                <b>About:</b>As elder statesman and genre godfather, Stephen King is a familiar name in the Horror category. <br> He returns this year with Holly, which pits an old fan-favorite character—private investigator Holly <br> Gibney—against a pair of uniquely depraved antagonists. King’s book is part character study, part thriller, <br> and part cautionary tale concerning octogenarian academics.
